# Personal Projects

This repository contains projects I’ve worked on beyond academic coursework to explore different machine learning algorithms and approaches to data science using topics that interest me.

The goal of this repository is to experiment, learn, and apply data science and machine learning techniques in a more open, self-directed way.


| Project | Description | Tools |
|--------|------------|------|
| **2025 US Open Predictor** | First personal project exploring XGBoost on historical ATP tennis data | Python, XGBoost |

### 2025 US Open Predictor
My **first personal data science project**, created to experiment with **XGBoost**, an algorithm I hadn’t used before. Using historical ATP data, I built a model to predict outcomes for the 2025 US Open Men’s Singles. I chose tennis because I was actively following the tournament and found an expansive, publicly available dataset on Kaggle.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
