# Personal Projects

This repository contains projects I’ve worked on beyond academic coursework to explore different machine learning algorithms and approaches to data science using topics that interest me.

The goal of this repository is to experiment, learn, and apply data science and machine learning techniques in a more open, self-directed way.
